# WolframAlpha-GoogleHome-Integration
Links google actions to wolfram server to ping questions directly into their server, expanding google actions results to include those like derivatives and integrals.

## What is a Google Home?
A google home is pretty much Google’s product of an Alexa.  It’s an automated personal assistant, meaning it uses artificial intelligent code to relay responses or actions to different requests.  Useful things it can do include actions such as play music, set timers and alarms, give you the weather, and pretty much any other questions you have.  All the information goes through Google’s Google Actions which utilizes the google search engine for answers and other useful information.  It is activated with the invocation of either “Hey Google,” or “Ok Google.”
## What is API.AI?
API.AI is a website that features free support for artificial intelligent (AI) app building.  While this may sound confusing, it’s just a simplified way to create AI programs without the need for programming in a simple modular design and view.  There’s two parts of the website that make it so vital for this project, which are integrations and fulfillment. Integrations are where the website can push information to, such as google actions, but can also be used for Facebook messenger or Slack.  Fulfillment is when the app uses a website to fulfill external information needed, where in this case it utilizes Wolfram, but it can also use websites like Yahoo Weather.
## What is Heroku?
Heroku is a cloud platform that hosts programs to be accessed through the web or a URL.  In my project, Heroku is the website where the fulfillment from API.AI occurs to gain access to Wolfram Alpha.  It basically hosts the python code I deploy to it to be a connector between programming and the world-wide web.  It has useful tools such as logs to show the process of the app and easy to deploy functions like taking code from your drobox.
## What is Python?
Python is a programming language, like Java and C++, it’s just a way to code inputs for a computer to do.  My Python file is relatively simple for accessing the wolfram site, but it can be used to build almost anything.
## What is Wolfram Alpha?
Wolfram Alpha is Mathematica computing engine.  Think of google search, but geared for math.  If you’ve never seen it, give it a try, any input or function you put it, Wolfram Alpha spits out huge amounts of output to fulfill the request.  While for the project I just wanted the simple first answer, there’s multitudes of information not included.
## Problem?
When I first bought my google home, I would ask it several math questions hoping it would help answer calculus work.  When I figured out it couldn’t solve even simple derivatives and integrals, I was honestly kind of disappointed.  Therefore, I decided I’d make my own app to solve simplistic calculus problems like derivatives, and integrate it into the Google Home.  This is shown in the flow chart below, and uses multiple programs and apps to connect to the Wolfram Alpha server and finally compute derivatives and integrals.
